
For MongoDB:

Pls dowload and install it on you PC
Make sure that you have MongoDBCompass in your installation package. 
Run MongoDBCompass - press 'connect'- run the spider

To run the spider you need to set the directory
example:
C:\Users\Files\upwork\upwork\upwork\spiders> 

After you are in the 'spiders' folder pls type next:

scrapy crawl adorebeauty

After you start running the scraper pls find txt file called "log". So you can see there the whole prosses of crawling and all ERRORS messages etc.
My tip is to delete it every time after you run the scraper.
